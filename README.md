# TimelapseDrone
Wheel Drone Control System designed for slow-motion video shooting (the so-called timelapse), in which the camera moves along a given route and shoots at a speed of several frames per second to several frames per minute.

After editing the received frames into a video with a normal frequency of 24 frames per second, we get a video on which one can observe quite significant periods of time in an accelerated form. The platform allows you to slowly move the camera according to a given program during the shooting process without the participation of an operator. The platform is fully mobile and can be used outdoors. In addition to linear movements, it also allows you to change the horizontal and vertical tilt of the camera.

* Rated for use with a GoPro Hero 3 or any other camera weighing up to 200 grams
* Linear movements - movement at a speed of 90 cm / s to 1 cm per hour. For low speeds, the platform moves in impulses. Moves a short distance (about 1-2 cm) with a minimum speed of about 1 cm / s, then stops until the next movement. The time between pulses can be any, which allows very low speeds to be achieved. Due to the fact that a single frame is captured at the moment of time between movement pulses, such movement does not affect the uniformity of the final video sequence.
* Steering - Independent wheel steering allows the platform to move in both straight and curved paths. Possibility of turning on the spot
* Horizontal panning - using a stepper motor with an optional reduction gear, the camera can be rotated with an accuracy of 1/3° or 1/960 of a turn. The turning speed is adjustable from 500 rpm to 0.3° per hour. For low speeds, the camera rotates impulsively (one impulse - 0.3°). The time between pulses can be anything, which makes it possible to achieve very low speeds. Due to the small step value at any rotation speed, horizontal panning does not affect the uniformity of the final video sequence.
* Vertical Pan - The camera can pan vertically from 0° to 180° at speeds from 1.14 rpm (0.57 sec from 0° to 180° degrees) to 1 degree per hour. For low speeds, the turn is made in impulses (one impulse - 1°). The time between pulses can be anything, which makes it possible to achieve very low speeds. Due to the small step value at any rotation speed, horizontal panning does not affect the uniformity of the final video sequence.
* Use of both one and two drives of vertical rotation is possible. In the second case, the camera is attached to a kind of small manipulator that can be raised, lowered or rotated by any of the hinges.
* Power supply - independent, either from standard AA cells (9 pcs), or from any source of direct current with a voltage of 12 volts and a current of up to 2A

• Operating time - from several minutes to tens of hours (allows you to shoot timelapse with the change of time of day).

• Number of programmable actions – up to 400. One action can be rectilinear or curvilinear movement of the platform, horizontal or vertical panning of the camera at specified speeds. The moment of the beginning of the action and its duration are programmed in advance, from one second to several hours.
At any time, you can start or stop the execution of programmed actions using the controls available on the platform. Changing the program will require a connection to a PC via USB.
